   - ⬜ Tooltips and help text
   - ⬜ Onboarding experience
   - ⬜ Keyboard shortcuts documentation

## Known Issues

1. **Flowchart Implementation**

   - The flowchart component is currently a skeleton with empty nodes and edges arrays
   - Node changes, edge changes, and connection handlers are empty functions
   - Node connections are not yet implemented
   - No state management for decision selections

2. **Data Completeness**

   - Limited decision data currently available
   - Relationship mapping between decisions is incomplete
   - Character requirements not fully implemented
   - Need more comprehensive data for meaningful flowchart testing

3. **UI/UX**

   - Sidebar functionality is limited
   - No filtering or search implemented
   - Mobile experience needs improvement
   - Limited visual differentiation between decision types

4. **Performance**
   - Performance with large decision trees not yet tested
   - Potential rendering optimizations needed for complex flowcharts
   - No virtualization for large numbers of nodes

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Approach

- Focus on building a solid foundation with TypeScript and React
- Use ReactFlow for flowchart visualization
- Organize data by game acts and locations
- Begin with local component state before implementing global state

### Current Direction

- Continuing with the initial technical approach
- Implementing decision nodes with collapsible options
- Using context menus for node operations
- Prioritizing core flowchart functionality before expanding features
- Working on connecting global state with local component state

### Future Considerations

- May need more robust state management as complexity grows
- Consider performance optimizations for large decision trees
- Evaluate persistence options beyond local storage
- Explore more sophisticated layout algorithms for complex flowcharts
- Consider adding user accounts for sharing flowcharts
