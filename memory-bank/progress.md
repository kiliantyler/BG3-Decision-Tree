# Progress: Baldur's Gate 3 Decision Flowchart

## Current Status

The project is in early development with foundational components and structure in place. Based on the codebase examination, the current status is:

**Project Stage**: Early Development / Foundation Building

### What Works

1. **Project Setup**

   - ✅ Vite + React + TypeScript configuration
   - ✅ ESLint and Prettier setup
   - ✅ Storybook integration
   - ✅ Basic project structure

2. **UI Framework**

   - ✅ Theme provider with dark mode support
   - ✅ Basic layout structure
   - ✅ Shadcn UI components imported and ready for customization
   - ✅ Reusable UI components (buttons, cards, etc.)
   - ✅ Sidebar component with toggle functionality

3. **Flowchart Foundation**

   - ✅ ReactFlow integration
   - ✅ Basic flowchart canvas
   - ✅ Decision node component structure

4. **Data Structure**
   - ✅ TypeScript interfaces for decisions, acts, and characters
   - ✅ Initial data organization by acts and locations
   - ✅ Basic decision option structure

## What's Left to Build

### Core Functionality

1. **Decision State Management**

   - ⬜ Global decision state
   - ⬜ Decision selection handling
   - ⬜ State persistence

2. **Flowchart Interactions**

   - ⬜ Node connection logic
   - ⬜ Drag and drop from sidebar
   - ⬜ Node positioning and layout
   - ⬜ Node removal and consequences

3. **Data Expansion**
   - ⬜ Comprehensive decision data for Act 1
   - ⬜ Decision data for Act 2
   - ⬜ Decision data for Act 3
   - ⬜ Character relationship data

### User Experience

1. **Filtering and Search**

   - ⬜ Filter by act, location, and decision type
   - ⬜ Search functionality
   - ⬜ Sorting options

2. **Visual Enhancements**

   - ⬜ Node styling based on decision type
   - ⬜ Edge styling for relationships
   - ⬜ Visual indicators for prerequisites and unlocks
   - ⬜ Animation and transitions

3. **Mobile Experience**
   - ⬜ Responsive layout for smaller screens
   - ⬜ Touch-friendly interactions
   - ⬜ Mobile-specific UI adjustments

### Advanced Features

1. **Persistence**

   - ⬜ Local storage for saving flowcharts
   - ⬜ Import/export functionality

2. **Debug Mode**

   - ⬜ Tree statistics
   - ⬜ Decision database browser
   - ⬜ Canvas data inspection

3. **Documentation**
   - ⬜ User guide
   - ⬜ Tooltips and help text
   - ⬜ Onboarding experience

## Known Issues

1. **Flowchart Implementation**

   - The flowchart component is currently a skeleton without active node management
   - Node connections are not yet implemented
   - No state management for decision selections

2. **Data Completeness**

   - Limited decision data currently available
   - Relationship mapping between decisions is incomplete
   - Character requirements not fully implemented

3. **UI/UX**

   - Sidebar functionality is limited
   - No filtering or search implemented
   - Mobile experience needs improvement

4. **Performance**
   - Performance with large decision trees not yet tested
   - Potential rendering optimizations needed for complex flowcharts

## Recent Progress

### Completed Recently

1. Initial project setup with Vite, React, and TypeScript
2. Basic component structure for flowchart and sidebar
3. Theme support with dark mode
4. TypeScript interfaces for core data types
5. Initial UI component library

### In Progress

1. Decision node component development
2. Sidebar implementation
3. Data structure refinement
4. ReactFlow integration

## Next Milestones

### Milestone 1: Basic Flowchart Functionality

- Implement decision state management
- Enable node connections based on prerequisites
- Add basic drag-and-drop from sidebar
- Complete initial styling for nodes and edges

### Milestone 2: Data and Interactions

- Expand decision data for Act 1
- Implement filtering and search
- Add visual indicators for decision types
- Enable decision selection and consequence visualization

### Milestone 3: User Experience Enhancements

- Improve mobile responsiveness
- Add persistence with local storage
- Implement debug mode
- Create basic user documentation

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Approach

- Focus on building a solid foundation with TypeScript and React
- Use ReactFlow for flowchart visualization
- Organize data by game acts and locations

### Current Direction

- Continuing with the initial technical approach
- Prioritizing core flowchart functionality before expanding features
- Focusing on user experience and visual clarity

### Future Considerations

- May need more robust state management as complexity grows
- Consider performance optimizations for large decision trees
- Evaluate persistence options beyond local storage
