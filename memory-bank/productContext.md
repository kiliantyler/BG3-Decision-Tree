# Product Context: Baldur's Gate 3 Decision Flowchart

## Why This Project Exists

Baldur's Gate 3 is a complex role-playing game with numerous branching storylines, character interactions, and consequential decisions. Players often face challenges in:

1. **Understanding Decision Consequences**: Many choices have far-reaching effects that aren't immediately obvious
2. **Planning Character Journeys**: Players want to plan optimal paths for different character builds and roleplay scenarios
3. **Avoiding Missed Content**: The game has significant content that can be missed based on decisions
4. **Managing Companion Relationships**: Decisions affect companion approval and availability
5. **Tracking Quest Dependencies**: Some quests require specific prerequisites or become unavailable after certain choices

This project exists to address these challenges by providing a visual tool that helps players understand and plan their journey through the game.

## Problems It Solves

1. **Decision Visualization**: Transforms complex text-based decision trees into intuitive visual flowcharts
2. **Consequence Awareness**: Shows the immediate and downstream effects of each decision
3. **Path Planning**: Allows players to map out their intended gameplay path before committing in-game
4. **Content Discovery**: Helps players discover content they might otherwise miss
5. **Companion Management**: Assists in planning which companions to bring for specific quests
6. **Quest Tracking**: Provides a clear view of quest dependencies and mutual exclusivity

## How It Should Work

### User Journey

1. **Initial Exploration**: User opens the application and sees the starting decision nodes
2. **Decision Selection**: User selects outcomes for key decisions, which dynamically updates available paths
3. **Path Visualization**: As decisions are made, the flowchart expands to show new options
4. **Optional Content**: User can drag optional quests from the sidebar onto the canvas
5. **Organization**: User can rearrange nodes to create a clear visual representation
6. **Refinement**: User can change decisions to explore alternative paths
7. **Reference**: User refers to the flowchart while playing the game to guide their choices

### Core Functionality

1. **Dynamic Flowchart**: The flowchart updates in real-time as users make decisions
2. **Decision Nodes**: Each node represents a key decision point with multiple options
3. **Consequence Visualization**: Visual indicators show the impact of each choice
4. **Prerequisite Linking**: Nodes automatically connect to their prerequisites
5. **Filtering System**: Users can filter by act, location, or decision type
6. **Search Capability**: Users can search for specific decisions or characters
7. **Optional vs. Required**: Clear distinction between required story decisions and optional content

## User Experience Goals

1. **Intuitive Interface**: Users should understand how to use the tool with minimal instruction
2. **Visual Clarity**: The flowchart should be easy to read and understand
3. **Responsive Interaction**: The application should respond quickly to user actions
4. **Flexibility**: Users should be able to easily modify their decisions and see updated paths
5. **Accessibility**: The tool should be usable by players with different levels of gaming experience
6. **Spoiler Management**: Users should be able to control the level of detail shown to avoid unwanted spoilers
7. **Efficiency**: Users should be able to quickly find and make decisions without unnecessary complexity

## Target Audience

1. **New Players**: Those planning their first playthrough who want guidance without spoilers
2. **Experienced Players**: Those planning specific builds or achievement runs
3. **Completionists**: Players who want to ensure they experience all content
4. **Role-players**: Players who want to plan character-consistent decision paths
5. **Content Creators**: Those creating guides or walkthroughs for the game

## Success Metrics

1. **User Engagement**: Time spent using the application
2. **Flowchart Complexity**: Number of decisions mapped in typical user sessions
3. **Feature Utilization**: Usage of filtering, search, and organization features
4. **User Satisfaction**: Feedback on how well the tool helps with game planning
5. **Community Adoption**: Sharing and discussion of the tool in BG3 communities
