# Project Brief: Baldur's Gate 3 Decision Flowchart

## Project Overview

The BG3-Decision-Tree is an interactive visual tool designed to help players plan their journey through Baldur's Gate 3 by creating a flowchart of game decisions. It allows users to visualize the consequences of their choices and plan their gameplay path.

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Interactive Flowchart Creation**: Users can create a visual representation of their game decisions
2. **Decision Management**: Users can select outcomes for each decision and see what new options become available
3. **Act Organization**: Decisions are organized by game acts and locations
4. **Filtering System**: Users can filter decisions by type (required/optional) and availability
5. **Search Functionality**: Users can quickly find specific decisions
6. **Auto-Connection**: Nodes automatically connect to prerequisites when available
7. **Visual Indicators**: Different visual cues for optional vs. required quests
8. **Real-time Updates**: Changes to decisions automatically unlock new options
9. **Developer Mode**: Debug tools accessible via keyboard shortcut (CTRL+SHIFT+D)

### Technical Requirements

1. **React-based UI**: Modern, component-based architecture
2. **TypeScript Implementation**: Type-safe code with clear interfaces
3. **Responsive Design**: Works across different screen sizes
4. **Performance Optimization**: Efficient rendering of complex flowcharts
5. **State Management**: Effective management of decision states and relationships
6. **Data Structure**: Well-organized data for game decisions and relationships

## Project Goals

1. Create an intuitive tool for BG3 players to plan their gameplay decisions
2. Provide visual clarity on how decisions affect game progression
3. Help players understand the consequences of their choices
4. Support different playstyles and character builds
5. Create a maintainable and extensible codebase
6. Deliver a polished user experience with modern web technologies

## Success Criteria

1. Users can successfully create, visualize, and modify decision flowcharts
2. The application accurately represents game decision relationships
3. The interface is intuitive and requires minimal learning curve
4. The application performs well even with complex decision trees
5. The codebase is well-structured and maintainable

## Future Expansion

1. Add persistence with local storage or backend
2. Support for saving/loading multiple flowcharts
3. Add more detailed info about consequences
4. Implement decision tooltips for additional information
5. Mobile responsive design
6. Import/export functionality
